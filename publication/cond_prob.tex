\section{Conditional Output Probabilities}
The use of circuit output probabilities in digital systems engineering tasks
in the past has generally centered around the computation of the probabilities of single
functions. 
In this section we will use conditional output probability expressions
to show how some interesting relationships may be derived and we show
how output probability values may be related to cover sets of Boolean functions.
Unless otherwise noted, the conditioned quantity will always be dependent
upon the function of interest.  Therefore, the probability space for the
conditional output probability, $\wp \{ f | f_c \}$, has a size of $2^{n-m}$ where
$n$ is the number of dependent variables of $f$ and $m$ is the number of mutually
dependent variables of $f$ and $f_c$.

\subsection{Output Probabilities of Shannon Co-Factors}
It is convenient to describe conditional output probabilities by examining the
output probabilities of cofactor functions as used in the Shannon expansion.
The Shannon expansion theorem is well known and can be used to define cofactors.
It is given in Equations \ref{eq:sh_1}, \ref{eq:sh_2}, and \ref{eq:sh_3}.

\begin{equation}
f(x_1, x_2, \ldots , x_{i-1}, x_i, x_{i+1}, \ldots , x_n) = \overline{x}_i f_0 + x_i f_1 \label{eq:sh_1}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
f_0 = f(x_1, x_2, \ldots , x_{i-1}, 0, x_{i+1}, \ldots , x_n) \label{eq:sh_2}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
f_1 = f(x_1, x_2, \ldots , x_{i-1}, 1, x_{i+1}, \ldots , x_n) \label{eq:sh_3}
\end{equation}

Many other useful functions such as smoothing, consensus, and the Boolean derivative can
be defined in terms of the cofactors, $f_0$ and $f_1$.  Thus, it is interesting to
determine the output probability of the cofactors.

Consider the cofactor, $f_1$, for a particular variable, $x_i$.  The output probability
is computed as the total number of times $f_1 = 1$ divided by $2^{n-1}$ if $f$ is a 
completely specified function of $n$ variables.  In terms of probability theory,
this becomes the conditional probability value, $\wp \{f | x_i \}$.  Using Baye's Rule
the conditional probability may be expressed as given in Equation \ref{eq:baye}.
Note that $\wp \{ x_i \} \neq 0$ is always necessarily true when Equation \ref{eq:baye} is
used.  This is due to the fact that the cofactors are always computed in terms of dependent
$x_i$.  The trivial case where $x_i=0$ and hence $\wp \{ x_i \} = 0$ indicates that $f$ does not
depend upon $x_i$ and is thus not applicable to Equation \ref{eq:baye}, indeed, in this case
$x_i$ is not a Boolean variable, it is a Boolean constant.

\begin{equation}
\wp \{ f | x_i \} = \frac{\wp \{f \cdot x_i \} }{\wp \{x_i \} }   \label{eq:baye}
\end{equation}

Since it is typical to deal with fully specified functions, $\wp \{ x_i \} = \frac{1}{2}$,
and Equation \ref{eq:baye} simplifies to $\wp \{ f | x_i \} = 2 \cdot \wp \{f \cdot x_i \}$.

\subsection{Output Probabilities and Covers of Boolean Functions}
It is possible to compute conditional probabilities for more complex constituent
functions, $\wp \{ f | f_c \}$.  The use of Baye's theorem allows a very succinct
method for determining if a given function $f$ covers another function, $f_c$.
Lemma \ref{baye_cov} states and proves this result.

\begin{lemma}   \label{baye_cov}
A function $f$ covers another function, $f_c$, if and only if
$\wp \{f_c | f \} = \wp \{ f \}$.
\end{lemma}

\noindent
{\bf Proof:} \\
By definition, a cover of function $f_c$ by another function, $f$
means that for all $f_c=1$, $f$ is also at a logic `1' value.
In terms of conditional probabilities, this is stated as
$\wp \{ f_c | f \} = 1$.  Substituting this expression into 
Equation \ref{eq:baye} yields the following result.

\begin{equation}
\wp \{ f \cdot f_c \} = \wp \{ f \}    \label{eq:cover_result}
\end{equation}

This substitution is valid for all cases where $f$ and $f_c$ have mutual dependence
on a common subset of variables.  This dependence assumption prevents $\wp \{ f_c \} =0$.
It is trivial to ensure dependence since it is only necessary to show that at least
one common variable is present in some canonical form of $f$ and $f_c$.

\hfill $\Box$

This result can be very useful in synthesis algorithms that require
efficient means for checking covers.  Depending on the way $f$ and $f_c$
are represented initially, computing the two probability
values in Equation \ref{eq:cover_result} may prove to be much faster
than other methods such checking for intersections using cube sets.

Many logic optimization algorithms rely upon repeatedly computing relationships
among a set of cubes representing a logic function.  In particular, the computations
commonly involve determining if cubes are {\em disjoint}, {\em totally redundant},
or {\em partially redundant}.  In this section, we show that conditional probability
values may be used to quickly determine which of these three relationships are present
between any pair of cubes from a set that represent some function, $f$.

The {\em totally redundant} category is really a special case of lemma \ref{baye_cov}.
In this case we say that a cube, $c_i$, is totally redundant with respect to cube $c_j$
if $c_j$ covers $c_i$.  Two cubes, $c_i$ and $c_j$ are {\em disjoint} when they each cover
mutually exclusive portions of the range of the Boolean function $f$.
Finally, $c_i$ and $c_j$ are {\em partially redundant} if they each cover an intersecting 
subset of the range of $f$.  The following lemmas show the relationships between the
conditional probabilities of pairs of cubes and their relationship.

\begin{lemma}   \label{tot_redun}
Given two cubes $c_i$ and $c_j$ from a cover set of a function $f$,
$\wp \{ c_i | c_j \} = 1$ if and only if $c_i$ is totally redundant.
\end{lemma}

\noindent
{\bf Proof:} \\
Since $\wp \{ c_j \} \neq 0$, the conditional probability can be computed 
as:

\begin{equation}
\wp \{ c_i | c_j \} = \frac{ \wp \{ c_i \cdot c_j \} }{ \wp \{ c_j \}} \label{eq:cub_baye}
\end{equation}

When cube $c_i$ is totally redundant, $c_i \cdot c_j = c_j$.  Substituting
this result into Equation \ref{eq:cub_baye} it is seen that
$\wp \{ c_i | c_j \} = 1$.  

\hfill $\Box$

\begin{lemma}   \label{disjoint}
Given two cubes $c_i$ and $c_j$ from a cover set of a function $f$,
$\wp \{ c_i | c_j \} = 0$ if and only if $c_i$ and $c_j$ are disjoint.
\end{lemma}

\noindent
{\bf Proof:} \\
Since $\wp \{ c_j \} \neq 0$, the conditional probability can be computed 
as:

\begin{equation}
\wp \{ c_i | c_j \} = \frac{ \wp \{ c_i \cdot c_j \} }{ \wp \{ c_j \}}
\end{equation}

When the cubes $c_i$ and $c_j$ are disjoint, $c_i \cdot c_j  = 0$.
Thus, the conditional probability becomes 
$\wp \{ c_i | c_j \} = \frac{ \wp \{ 0 \} } { \wp \{ c_j \}} = 0$.

\hfill $\Box$

\begin{lemma}   \label{par_redun}
Given two cubes $c_i$ and $c_j$ from a cover set of a function $f$,
$\wp \{ c_i | c_j \} = p$, where $p$ lies in the interval $(0,1)$
if and only if $c_i$ and $c_j$ are partially redundant.
\end{lemma}

\noindent
{\bf Proof:} \\
When $\wp \{ c_i | c_j \} = p$, there is necessarily some dependence between
$c_i$ and $c_j$, therefore they cannot be disjoint and $\wp \{ c_i | c_j \} \neq 0$.
Further, since $p < 1$, $c_i$ is not totally redundant.  The only possible remaining
relationship between $c_i$ and $c_j$ is that they are partially redundant.

\hfill $\Box$

When a cube is a specific minterm, $m_i$, the conditional probability becomes
$\wp \{ f | m_i \} = 0$ or $\wp \{f | m_i \} = 1$.  This is due to the
fact that the probability space is reduced in size to $2^{n-n} = 1$, hence
it consists of a single experiment.  The outcome of this experiment is that the
function either covers the minterm, or, does not.  Hence, a conditional
probability, $\wp \{ f | m_i \}$ indicates if the function depends upon $m_i$ and
the real value of the probability is the same as the Boolean value of the function when it is
evaluated at that particular minterm.  This result comes directly from the above lemmas 
since it is impossible for a specific minterm and a function to be partially redundant.

\subsection{Smoothing, Consensus, and Boolean Derivatives}
Three other operators are important in Boolean algebra and they may be defined
in terms of cofactors.  These are the Boolean derivative (Boolean difference), 
the consensus operator (universal quantifier), and the smoothing operator
(existential quantifier).
These may each be defined as follows.

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{x_i}} = f_0 \oplus f_1  \label{eq:bool_diff}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
C_{x_i}(f) = f_0 \cdot f_1  \label{eq:bool_con}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
S_{x_i}(f) = f_0 + f_1 \label{eq:bool_smooth}
\end{equation}

These operations are interrelated in the Boolean domain as expressed in Equation \ref{eq:con_rel}.

\begin{equation}
\overline{C_{x_i}(f)} \cdot S_{x_i}(f) = \frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{x_i}} \label{eq:con_rel}
\end{equation}

The Boolean derivative provides a measure of the observability of a particular
input variable.  When $\partial{f}/\partial{x_i}=0$, $x_i$ is an unobservable
input.  Therefore, the observability as a whole may be measured by computing
the output probability of $\partial{f}/\partial{x_i}$ with values close to
zero indicating that $x_i$ is relatively unobservable and does not greatly affect the two
cofactors in different ways.  

The consensus of a Boolean function represents the component of the function that is
independent of a variable, $x_i$.  Thus, very small output probabilities of the consensus
function can be used to indicate that some function, $f$, is highly dependent upon a variable
$x_i$.  The degree of dependence of a function with respect to a dependent variable is a commonly used
heuristic for OBDD variable ordering algorithms \cite{SM92}.  Using the output
probabilities of the consensus functions could prove to be very useful for this application.

The smoothing operator represents the behavior of a function when the dependence of that
function on a particular variable, $x_i$, is suppressed.  Smoothing can also be used as a measure
of the degree that a particular function ,$f$, depends upon a variable, $x_i$.

These quantities have not seen a lot of practical use in the past since they are often difficult
to compute symbolically.  However, it is possible that the use of the output probability of these
measures could provide useful insights into the relationship between a function and an input variable.
Furthermore, it is only necessary to compute the consensus of a function in the Boolean domain
(i.e., AND the two cofactors together) in order to obtain the output probabilities of any of the three
operations.

The following equations express the relationship of the output probability computations.

\begin{equation}
\wp \{ \frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{x_i}} \} = \wp \{ f_{x_i} \cdot \overline{f}_{\overline{x}_i} \} + \wp \{ \overline{f}_{x_i} \cdot f_{\overline{x}_i} \} - \wp \{ f_{x_i} \cdot \overline{f}_{\overline{x}_i} \} \wp \{ \overline{f}_{x_i} \cdot f_{\overline{x}_i} \} \label{eq:pbd}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\wp \{ C_{x_i}(f) \} = \wp \{ f_{x_i} \cdot f_{\overline{x}_i} \}  \label{eq:pc}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\wp \{ S_{x_i}(f) \} = 1 - \wp \{ \overline{f}_{x_i} \cdot \overline{f}_{\overline{x}_i} \} \label{eq:ps}
\end{equation}

Equations \ref{eq:pbd}, \ref{eq:pc}, and \ref{eq:ps} indicate that the output probabilities
of these three important operators can be easily obtained provided that the four fundamental
probabilities of $\wp \{ f_{x_i} \cdot f_{\overline{x}_i} \}$, 
$\wp \{ f_{x_i} \cdot \overline{f}_{\overline{x}_i} \}$,
$ \wp \{ \overline{f}_{x_i} \cdot f_{\overline{x}_i} \}$, and 
$\wp \{ \overline{f}_{x_i} \cdot \overline{f}_{\overline{x}_i} \}$ are easily obtainable.
